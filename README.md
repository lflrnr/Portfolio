Projects showcasing Python centric data analysis and data science skills.


## Project 1 - Rohingya Humanitarian Operations

Rohingya Refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - Exploring and Visualizing Data<br/>
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/iscg-4w-influx-cox-s-bazar-bangladesh

The Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) is an umbrella entity of partners and organizations coordinating the provision of services to Rohingya refugees and host communities in the Cox's Bazar area of Bangladesh. Each month, the ISCG collects and publishes data on activities for the affected communities and areas. The data below is for for the month of July 2021 and was downloaded on 2021-09-28 in .xlsx format. The goal is to use Python libraries to explore real world data, generate descriptive statistics and visuals. For such a large and complex dataset, it seems that much effort went into cleaning the data which greatly aided with this portfolio project.

Skills: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Networkx and Pyvis

## Project 2 - Rohingya and Hope

Xchange conducted a survey of the perceptions of new adult arrivals to Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh after the August 2017 military operations in Rakhine State, Myanmar. The goals for this analysis were to utilize Python libraries to explore real world data, generate descriptive statistics and visuals, and to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to assess which survey features are strong predictors of hope expresesed at the very end of the survey. The data was from 2019 and was downloaded on 2021-12-06 in .xlsx format from the third hyperlink above. The majority of the data were categorical with both ordinal and non-ordinal features.

The scikit-learn machine algorithms that are utilized (sklearn calls are in parenthesis): Support Vector Classifier (SVC) K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNeighborsClassifier) Logistic Regression (LogisticRegression) - did not work Naive Bayes Classifier (MultinomialNB) Decision Tree Classifier (DecisionTreeClassifier) - implemented with default parameters as well as pruned leaf nodes, max depth and entropy Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier) Ada Boost Classifier (AdaBoostClassifier) Gradient Boosting Classifier (GradientBoostingClassifier)

Skills: Python; Pandas; Numpy; Matplotlib; Seaborn; Data Munging; Feature Engineering; Machine Learning Algorithms, Grid Search & Cross Validation, and Model Performance Evaluation.
